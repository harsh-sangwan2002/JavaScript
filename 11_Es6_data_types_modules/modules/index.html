    <!-- 1. When we have mutiple script file then all of them work as a big single script file.
         2. Order is also important -> to maintain order network
         3. There is scope pollution
         4. There is no abstraction as well -->

    <!-- <script src="lib.js"></script>
    <script src="client.js"></script> -->
    
    <!-- Modules 
        1. There is no concpet of order -> export and import + network??
        2. There is no scope pollution
        3. You can implement abstraction
        4. It is in strict mode
        5. Modules are cached -->
