## 🔍 Topic Overview

### 1. Hoisting 📤

Understand JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope. Learn how hoisting affects both variable and function declarations.

---

### 2. Polyfills 🛠️

Explore how to write **polyfills** to ensure backward compatibility for modern JavaScript features in older environments.

---

---

### 4. Promises 🤝

Dive into **Promises**—a powerful feature for handling asynchronous operations. Understand promise states, chaining, and error handling.

---

### 5. Higher-Order Functions (HOF) 🔄

Higher-Order Functions are a key concept in functional programming. Learn how to work with functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

---

### 6. apply(), bind(), call() 📞

Understand the **apply()**, **bind()**, and **call()** methods in JavaScript to control the `this` context and invoke functions dynamically.
